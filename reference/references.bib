provides conceptual simplicity, straightforward opportunities for
separately improving the component models, and a level of performance
comparable to similar, non-factored models. Most importantly, unlike
other modern parsing models, the factored model admits an extremely
effective A* parsing algorithm, which enables efficient, exact
inference.},

Inference algorithms for Markov logic draw on ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo and knowledge-based model construction. Learning algorithms are based on the voted perceptron, pseudo-likelihood and inductive logic programming. Markov logic has been successfully applied to problems in entity resolution, link prediction, information extraction and others, and is the basis of the open-source Alchemy system.},

The software agent provides intelligent, mixed initiative assistance without requiring natural language understanding. A key benefit of the collaboration manager is the automatic construction of an interaction history which is hierarchically structured according to the user's and agent's goals and intentions.",
